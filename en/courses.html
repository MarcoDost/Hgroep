			<h2> About our courses </h2>

			<p> At De Zwolle Hogeschool you can follow the courses of Information technology and Mechanical engineering. De Zwolle Hogeschool offers four graduation 
			specialisations per available course.</p>

			<h3>Information technology</h3>
			<p> The course of Information technology is a four year period study in which you will learn to program, produce graphic designs and explore the possibilities 
				of networks all in the first year. In the second year you will be able to choose between four specialisations: software-engineering, IT network management,
			front-end-development and technical IT. Below is an overview of the year contents:</p>

			<h3> Year 1 </h3>
			<p><h4>	Getting to know the profession </h4>
				In the propedeutic year you'll get to know your future profession. You'll work in small groups on practicly oriented assignments. You'll be designing a 
				webshop or making a multimedia presentation for a company for example. You can even develop a completely new game. As you'll get further in the course, 
				you'll get to know all specilisations, so you will be able to choose the graduation specialisation that truly fits you.
				If you want to transfer to technical IT, you can do so easily, as the study programs for both normal and technical IT are identical in the first year. 
			More about the contents of the first year.</p>

			<h3> Year 2 </h3>
			<p><h4>	Advancement learning material </h4>
				You'll go deeper into the learning material which you already got to know, like programming languages and databases. Moreover, you'll specialise in your 
			chosen graduation specialisation. Additionally, you'll follow a short internship. More about the contents of the second year.</p>

			<h3> Year 3 </h3>
			<p><h4>	Internship and practical application </h4>
				The time has come to put your knowledge and experience into practice. For one half of the year you'll follow an internship domestically or abroad. This way 
			you'll develop an accurate picture of the different professions and functions of your line of work. More about the contents of the third year.</p>

			<h3> Year 4 </h3>
			<p><h4>	Graduation phase </h4>
				You'll finish the course with a practical graduation project of six months. You'll carry out this project at a company or organisation, perhaps even your future employer! 
			More about the contents of the fourth year.</p>

			<h3> Mechanical engineering </h3>
			<p> Mechanical appliances and developing sustainable products are crucial in this course. Apart from just the technical aspect, a lot of attention is given to the management 
			and commercial sides of product development. Below is an overview of the year contents:</p>

			<h3> Year 1 </h3>
